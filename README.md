# Welcome to the CGI GitHub page
The goal of the CGI is to develop, implement, and disseminate imaging, analysis, and modeling technologies that will elucidate how genomes, in their entirety, are organized and function in three dimensions (3D).
- Develop strategies to massively scale imaging methods.
- Develop strategies for distinguishing maternal and paternal homologs as well as visualizing repeated sequences.
- Produce computational pipelines to increase the power and speed of image analysis and genome 3D modeling. 
- Support the community through a CGI incubator, internships, and courses.
